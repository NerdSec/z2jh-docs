# Configuration Reference 

The [JupyterHub Helm
chart](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) is configurable by
values in your `config.yaml`. In this way, you can extend user resources, build off
of different Docker images, manage security and authentication, and more.

Below is a description of many *but not all* of the configurable values for the
Helm chart. To see *all* configurable options, inspect their default values
defined [here](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/jupyterhub/values.yaml).

```eval_rst
For more guided information about some specific things you can do with
modifications to the helm chart, see the :ref:`customization-guide`.
```
## hub

### hub.image

Set custom image name / tag for the hub pod.

Use this to customize which hub image is used. Note that you must use a version of
the hub image that was bundled with this particular version of the helm-chart - using
other images might not work.


#### hub.image.name

Name of the image, without the tag.

```
# example names
yuvipanda/wikimedia-hub
gcr.io/my-project/my-hub
```


#### hub.image.tag

The tag of the image to pull.

This is the value after the `:` in your full image name.

```
# example tags
v1.11.1
zhy270a
```


### hub.labels

Extra labels to add to the hub pod.

See the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)
to learn more about labels.


### hub.imagePullSecret

Creates an image pull secret for you and makes the hub pod utilize
it, allowing it to pull images from private image registries.

Using this configuration option automates the following steps that
normally is required to pull from private image registries.

```sh
# you won't need to run this manually...
kubectl create secret docker-registry hub-image-credentials \
  --docker-server=<REGISTRY> \
  --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
  --docker-email=<EMAIL> \
  --docker-password=<PASSWORD>
```

```yaml
# you won't need to specify this manually...
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: hub-image-credentials
```

To learn the username and password fields to access a gcr.io registry
from a Kubernetes cluster not associated with the same google cloud
credentials, look into [this
guide](http://docs.heptio.com/content/private-registries/pr-gcr.html)
and read the notes about the password.


#### hub.imagePullSecret.password

Password of the user you want to use to connect to your private
registry.

Examples:
  - plaintextpassword
  - abc123SECRETzyx098

For gcr.io registries the password will be a big JSON blob for a
Google cloud service account, it should look something like below.
              
```yaml
password: |-
  {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "jupyter-se",
    "private_key_id": "f2ba09118a8d3123b3321bd9a7d6d0d9dc6fdb85",
    ...
  }
```

Learn more in [this
guide](http://docs.heptio.com/content/private-registries/pr-gcr.html).


#### hub.imagePullSecret.username

Name of the user you want to use to connect to your private
registry. For external gcr.io, you will use the `_json_key`.

Examples:
  - alexmorreale
  - alex@pfc.com
  - _json_key


#### hub.imagePullSecret.enabled

Enable the creation of a Kubernetes Secret containing credentials
to access a image registry. By enabling this, the hub pod will also be configured
to use these credentials when it pulls its container image.


#### hub.imagePullSecret.registry

Name of the private registry you want to create a credential set
for. It will default to Docker Hub's image registry.

Examples:
  - https://index.docker.io/v1/
  - quay.io
  - eu.gcr.io
  - alexmorreale.privatereg.net


### hub.service

Object to configure the service the JupyterHub will be exposed on by the Kubernetes server.


#### hub.service.loadBalancerIP

The public IP address the hub service should be exposed on.

This sets the IP address that should be used by the LoadBalancer for exposing the hub service.
Set this if you want the hub service to be provided with a fixed external IP address instead of a dynamically acquired one.
Useful to ensure a stable IP to access to the hub with, for example if you have reserved an IP address in your network to communicate with the JupyterHub.

To be provided like:
```
hub:
  service:
    loadBalancerIP: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```


#### hub.service.type

The Kubernetes ServiceType to be used.

The default type is `ClusterIP`.
See the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)
to learn more about service types.


#### hub.service.ports

Object to configure the ports the hub service will be deployed on.


##### hub.service.ports.nodePort

The nodePort to deploy the hub service on.


#### hub.service.annotations

Kubernetes annotations to apply to the hub service.


### hub.extraEnv

Extra environment variables that should be set for the hub pod.

```yaml
hub:
  extraEnv:
    MY_ENV_VARS_NAME: "my env vars value"
```

**NOTE**: We still support this field being a list of
[EnvVar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#envvar-v1-core)
objects as well.

These are usually used in two circumstances:
  - Passing parameters to some custom code specified with `extraConfig`
  - Passing parameters to an authenticator or spawner that can be directly customized
    by environment variables (rarer)


### hub.cookieSecret

A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to sign values of
secure cookies set by the hub. If unset, jupyterhub will generate one on startup and
save it in the file `jupyterhub_cookie_secret` in the `/srv/jupyterhub` directory of
the hub container. A value set here will make JupyterHub overwrite any previous file.

You do not need to set this at all if you are using the default configuration for
storing databases - sqlite on a persistent volume (with `hub.db.type` set to the
default `sqlite-pvc`). If you are using an external database, then you must set this
value explicitly - or your users will keep getting logged out each time the hub pod
restarts.

Changing this value will all user logins to be invalidated. If this secret leaks,
*immediately* change it to something else, or user data can be compromised

```sh
# to generate a value, run
openssl rand -hex 32
```


### hub.uid

The UID the hub process should be running as.
Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a user with this uid exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!
Defaults to 1000, which is the uid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the default hub image.

### hub.pdb

Set the Pod Disruption Budget for the hub pod.

See [the Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/)
for more details about disruptions.


#### hub.pdb.minAvailable

Minimum number of pods to be available during the voluntary disruptions.


#### hub.pdb.enabled

Whether PodDisruptionBudget is enabled for the hub pod.


### hub.fsGid

The gid the hub process should be using when touching any volumes mounted.
Use this only if you are building your own image & know that a group with this gid exists inside the hub container! Advanced feature, handle with care!
Defaults to 1000, which is the gid of the `jovyan` user that is present in the default hub image.

### hub.imagePullPolicy

Set the imagePullPolicy on the hub pod.

See the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images)
for more info on what the values mean.


### hub.initContainers

list of initContainers to be run with hub pod. See [Kubernetes Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)

```yaml
hub:
  initContainers:
    - name: init-myservice
      image: busybox:1.28
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'command1']
    - name: init-mydb
      image: busybox:1.28
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'command2']
```


### hub.extraConfig

Arbitrary extra python based configuration that should be in `jupyterhub_config.py`.

This is the *escape hatch* - if you want to configure JupyterHub to do something specific
that is not present here as an option, you can write the raw Python to do it here.

extraConfig is a *dict*, so there can be multiple configuration snippets
under different names.
The configuration sections are run in alphabetical order.

Non-exhaustive examples of things you can do here:
  - Subclass authenticator / spawner to do a custom thing
  - Dynamically launch different images for different sets of images
  - Inject an auth token from GitHub authenticator into user pod
  - Anything else you can think of!

Since this is usually a multi-line string, you want to format it using YAML's
[| operator](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2795688).

For example:
  ```yaml
  hub:
    extraConfig:
      myConfig.py: |
        c.JupyterHub.something = 'something'
        c.Spawner.somethingelse = 'something else'
  ```

No validation of this python is performed! If you make a mistake here, it will probably
manifest as either the hub pod going into `Error` or `CrashLoopBackoff` states, or in
some special cases, the hub running but... just doing very random things. Be careful!


### hub.db

#### hub.db.password

Password for the database when `hub.db.type` is mysql or postgres.


#### hub.db.pvc

Customize the Persistent Volume Claim used when `hub.db.type` is `sqlite-pvc`.


##### hub.db.pvc.annotations

Annotations to apply to the PVC containing the sqlite database.

See [the Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)
for more details about annotations.


##### hub.db.pvc.storage

Size of disk to request for the database disk.


##### hub.db.pvc.selector

Label selectors to set for the PVC containing the sqlite database.

Useful when you are using a specific PV, and want to bind to
that and only that.

See [the Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)
for more details about using a label selector for what PV to
bind to.


#### hub.db.type

Type of database backend to use for the hub database.

The Hub requires a persistent database to function, and this lets you specify
where it should be stored.

The various options are:

1. **sqlite-pvc**

   Use an `sqlite` database kept on a persistent volume attached to the hub.

   By default, this disk is created by the cloud provider using
   *dynamic provisioning* configured by a [storage
   class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
   You can customize how this disk is created / attached by
   setting various properties under `hub.db.pvc`.

   This is the default setting, and should work well for most cloud provider
   deployments.

2. **sqlite-memory**

   Use an in-memory `sqlite` database. This should only be used for testing,
   since the database is erased whenever the hub pod restarts - causing the hub
   to lose all memory of users who had logged in before.

   When using this for testing, make sure you delete all other objects that the
   hub has created (such as user pods, user PVCs, etc) every time the hub restarts.
   Otherwise you might run into errors about duplicate resources.

3. **mysql**

   Use an externally hosted mysql database.

   You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the mysql database you
   want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

   The general format of the connection string is:
   ```
   mysql+pymysql://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
   ```

   The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
   tables in the database specified.

   Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.

4. **postgres**

   Use an externally hosted postgres database.

   You have to specify an sqlalchemy connection string for the postgres database you
   want to connect to in `hub.db.url` if using this option.

   The general format of the connection string is:
   ```
   postgres+psycopg2://<db-username>:<db-password>@<db-hostname>:<db-port>/<db-name>
   ```

   The user specified in the connection string must have the rights to create
   tables in the database specified.

   Note that if you use this, you *must* also set `hub.cookieSecret`.


#### hub.db.url

Connection string when `hub.db.type` is mysql or postgres.

See documentation for `hub.db.type` for more details on the format of this property.


## singleuser

Options for customizing the environment that is provided to the users after they log in.


### singleuser.image

Set custom image name / tag used for spawned users.

This image is used to launch the pod for each user.


#### singleuser.image.name

Note that this field is referred to as *requests* by the Kubernetes API.


### singleuser.extraNodeAffinity

Affinities describe where pods prefer or require to be scheduled, they
may prefer or require a node where they are to be scheduled to have a
certain label (node affinity). They may also require to be scheduled
in proximity or with a lack of proximity to another pod (pod affinity
and anti pod affinity).

See the [Kubernetes
docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/)
for more info.

documentation](https://jupyterhub-kubespawner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spawner.html#kubespawner.KubeSpawner)
as this is simply a passthrough to that configuration.

**NOTE**: The image-pullers are aware of the overrides of images in
`singleuser.profileList` but they won't be if you configure it in
JupyterHub's configuration of '`c.KubeSpawner.profile_list`.

```yaml
singleuser:
  profileList:
    - display_name: "Default: Shared, 8 CPU cores"
      description: "Your code will run on a shared machine with CPU only."
      default: True
    - display_name: "Personal, 4 CPU cores & 26GB RAM, 1 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU"
      description: "Your code will run a personal machine with a GPU."
      kubespawner_override:
        extra_resource_limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
```


### singleuser.imagePullSecret

Creates an image pull secret for you and makes the user pods utilize
it, allowing them to pull images from private image registries.

Using this configuration option automates the following steps that
normally is required to pull from private image registries.

```sh
# you won't need to run this manually...
kubectl create secret docker-registry singleuser-image-credentials \
  --docker-server=<REGISTRY> \
  --docker-username=<USERNAME> \
  --docker-email=<EMAIL> \
  --docker-password=<PASSWORD>
```

```yaml
# you won't need to specify this manually...
spec:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: singleuser-image-credentials
```

To learn the username and password fields to access a gcr.io registry
from a Kubernetes cluster not associated with the same google cloud
credentials, look into [this
guide](http://docs.heptio.com/content/private-registries/pr-gcr.html)
and read the notes about the password.


#### singleuser.imagePullSecret.password

Password of the user you want to use to connect to your private
registry.

Examples:
  - plaintextpassword
  - abc123SECRETzyx098

For gcr.io registries the password will be a big JSON blob for a
Google cloud service account, it should look something like below.
              
```yaml
password: |-
  {
    "type": "service_account",
    "project_id": "jupyter-se",
    "private_key_id": "f2ba09118a8d3123b3321bd9a7d6d0d9dc6fdb85",
    ...
  }
```

Learn more in [this
guide](http://docs.heptio.com/content/private-registries/pr-gcr.html).


#### singleuser.imagePullSecret.username

Name of the user you want to use to connect to your private
registry. For external gcr.io, you will use the `_json_key`.

Examples:
  - alexmorreale
  - alex@pfc.com
  - _json_key


#### singleuser.imagePullSecret.enabled

Enable the creation of a Kubernetes Secret containing credentials
to access a image registry. By enabling this, user pods and image
puller pods will also be configured to use these credentials when
they pull their container images.


#### singleuser.imagePullSecret.registry

Name of the private registry you want to create a credential set
for. It will default to Docker Hub's image registry.

Examples:
  - https://index.docker.io/v1/
  - quay.io
  - eu.gcr.io
  - alexmorreale.privatereg.net


### singleuser.extraTolerations

Tolerations allow a pod to be scheduled on nodes with taints. These
are additional tolerations other than the user pods and core pods
default ones `hub.jupyter.org/dedicated=user:NoSchedule` or
`hub.jupyter.org/dedicated=core:NoSchedule`. Note that a duplicate set
of tolerations exist where `/` is replaced with `_` as the Google
cloud does not support the character `/` yet in the toleration.

See the [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)
for more info.

Pass this field an array of
[`Toleration`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.19/#toleration-v1-core)
objects.


## scheduling

Objects for customizing the scheduling of various pods on the nodes and
related labels.


### scheduling.userPlaceholder

User placeholders simulate users but will thanks to PodPriority be
evicted by the cluster autoscaler if a real user shows up. In this way
placeholders allow you to create a headroom for the real users and
reduce the risk of a user having to wait for a node to be added. Be
sure to use the the continuous image puller as well along with
placeholders, so the images are also available when real users arrive.

To test your setup efficiently, you can adjust the amount of user
placeholders with the following command:
```sh
# Configure to have 3 user placeholders
kubectl scale sts/user-placeholder --replicas=3
```


#### scheduling.userPlaceholder.replicas

How many placeholder pods would you like to have?


#### scheduling.userPlaceholder.resources

Unless specified here, the placeholder pods will request the same
resources specified for the real singleuser pods.


#### scheduling.userPlaceholder.enabled

### scheduling.corePods

These settings influence the core pods like the hub, proxy and
user-scheduler pods.


#### scheduling.corePods.nodeAffinity

Where should pods be scheduled? Perhaps on nodes with a certain
label is preferred or even required?


##### scheduling.corePods.nodeAffinity.matchNodePurpose

Decide if core pods *ignore*, *prefer* or *require* to
schedule on nodes with this label:
```
hub.jupyter.org/node-purpose=core
```


### scheduling.podPriority

Pod Priority is used to allow real users evict placeholder pods that
in turn triggers a scale up by a cluster autoscaler. So, enabling this
option will only make sense if the following conditions are met:

1. Your Kubernetes cluster has at least version 1.11
2. A cluster autoscaler is installed
3. user-placeholer pods is configured to get a priority equal or
   higher than the cluster autoscaler's priority cutoff
4. Normal user pods have a higher priority than the user-placeholder
   pods

Note that if the default priority cutoff if not configured on cluster
autoscaler, it will currently default to 0, and that in the future
this is meant to be lowered. If your cloud provider is installing the
cluster autoscaler for you, they may also configure this specifically.

Recommended settings for a cluster autoscaler...

... with a priority cutoff of -10 (GKE):

```yaml
podPriority:
  enabled: true
  globalDefault: false
  defaultPriority: 0
  userPlaceholderPriority: -10
```

... with a priority cutoff of 0:

```yaml
podPriority:
  enabled: true
  globalDefault: true
  defaultPriority: 10
  userPlaceholderPriority: 0
```


#### scheduling.podPriority.globalDefault

Warning! This will influence all pods in the cluster.

The priority a pod usually get is 0. But this can be overridden
with a PriorityClass resource if it is declared to be the global
default. This configuration option allows for the creation of such
global default.


#### scheduling.podPriority.defaultPriority

The actual value for the default pod priority.


#### scheduling.podPriority.userPlaceholderPriority

The actual value for the user-placeholder pods' priority.


#### scheduling.podPriority.enabled

### scheduling.userScheduler

The user scheduler is making sure that user pods are scheduled
tight on nodes, this is useful for autoscaling of user node pools.


#### scheduling.userScheduler.image

The image containing the [kube-scheduler
binary](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/google-containers/GLOBAL/kube-scheduler-amd64).


##### scheduling.userScheduler.image.name

##### scheduling.userScheduler.image.tag

#### scheduling.userScheduler.replicas

You can have multiple schedulers to share the workload or improve
availability on node failure.


#### scheduling.userScheduler.enabled

Enables the user scheduler.


#### scheduling.userScheduler.pdb

Set the Pod Disruption Budget for the user scheduler.

See [the Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/)
for more details about disruptions.


##### scheduling.userScheduler.pdb.minAvailable

Minimum number of pods to be available during the voluntary disruptions.


##### scheduling.userScheduler.pdb.enabled

Whether PodDisruptionBudget is enabled for the user scheduler.


### scheduling.userPods

These settings influence the user pods like the user-placeholder,
user-dummy and actual user pods named like jupyter-someusername.


#### scheduling.userPods.nodeAffinity

Where should pods be scheduled? Perhaps on nodes with a certain
label is preferred or even required?


##### scheduling.userPods.nodeAffinity.matchNodePurpose

Decide if user pods *ignore*, *prefer* or *require* to
schedule on nodes with this label:
```
hub.jupyter.org/node-purpose=user
```


## auth

### auth.state

#### auth.state.cryptoKey

auth_state will be encrypted and stored in the Hub’s database. This can include things like authentication tokens, etc. to be passed to Spawners as environment variables.
Encrypting auth_state requires the cryptography package.
It must contain one (or more, separated by ;) 32-byte encryption keys. These can be either base64 or hex-encoded.
The JUPYTERHUB_CRYPT_KEY environment variable for the hub pod is set using this entry.

```sh
# to generate a value, run
openssl rand -hex 32
```

If encryption is unavailable, auth_state cannot be persisted.


#### auth.state.enabled

Enable persisting auth_state (if available).
See: http://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/auth.html


## ingress

### ingress.hosts

##### proxy.https.manual.key

The RSA private key to be used for HTTPS.
To be provided in the form of

```
key: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```


#### proxy.https.hosts

You domain in list form.
Required for automatic HTTPS. See [Set up automatic HTTPS](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html?highlight=security#set-up-automatic-https).
To be provided like:
```
hosts:
  - <your-domain-name>
```   


#### proxy.https.secret

Secret to be provided when setting `https.type` to `secret`.


##### proxy.https.secret.crt

Path to the certificate to be used for HTTPS. 
Example: `'tls.crt'`


##### proxy.https.secret.name

Name of the secret


##### proxy.https.secret.key

Path to the private key to be used for HTTPS. 
Example: `'tls.key'`


#### proxy.https.enabled

Indicator to set whether HTTPS should be enabled or not on the proxy. Defaults to `true` if the https object is provided.


### proxy.secretToken

A 32-byte cryptographically secure randomly generated string used to secure communications
between the hub and the configurable-http-proxy.

```sh
# to generate a value, run
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Changing this value will cause the proxy and hub pods to restart. It is good security
practice to rotate these values over time. If this secret leaks, *immediately* change
it to something else, or user data can be compromised


### proxy.pdb

Set the Pod Disruption Budget for the proxy pod.

See [the Kubernetes
documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/)
for more details about disruptions.


#### proxy.pdb.minAvailable

Minimum number of pods to be available during the voluntary disruptions.


#### proxy.pdb.enabled

Whether PodDisruptionBudget is enabled for the proxy pod.


## custom

Additional values to pass to the Hub.
JupyterHub will not itself look at these,
but you can read values in your own custom config via `hub.extraConfig`.
For example:

```yaml
custom:
  myHost: "https://example.horse"
hub:
  extraConfig:
    myConfig.py: |
      c.MyAuthenticator.host = get_config("custom.myHost")
```


## prePuller

### prePuller.extraImages

See the [*optimization section*](optimization.html#the-images-that-will-be-pulled) for more details.

```yaml
prePuller:
  extraImages:
    myExtraImageIWantPulled:
      name: jupyter/all-spark-notebook
      tag: 2343e33dec46
```


### prePuller.hook

See the [*optimization section*](optimization.html#pulling-images-before-users-arrive) for more details.


#### prePuller.hook.enabled

### prePuller.continuous

See the [*optimization section*](optimization.html#pulling-images-before-users-arrive) for more details.

**NOTE**: If used with a Cluster Autoscaler (an autoscaling node
pool), also add user-placeholders and enable pod priority.


#### prePuller.continuous.enabled
