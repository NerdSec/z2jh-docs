Community Resources
===================

This section gives the community a space to provide information on setting
up, managing, and maintaining JupyterHub.

.. important::
   We recognize that Kubernetes has many deployment options. As a project team
   with limited resources to provide end user support, we rely on community
   members to share their collective Kubernetes knowledge and JupyterHub
   experiences.

.. note::
   **Contributing to Z2JH**. If you would like to help improve the Zero to
   JupyterHub guide, please see the `issues page`_ as well as the `contributor guide
   <https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

We hope that you will use this section to share deployments with on a variety
of infrastructure and for different use cases.
There is also a :doc:`community maintained list <./users-list>` of users of this
Guide and the JupyterHub Helm Chart.

Please submit a pull request to add to this section. Thanks.
